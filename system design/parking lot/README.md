## Question: Design Parking Lot

A parking lot or car park is a dedicated cleared area that is intended for parking vehicles.

## System Requirements  
We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the parking lot:

- The parking lot should have multiple floors where customers can park their cars.

- Each parking floor will have many parking spots.

- Cars have two types -- Small and Large. Small cars charge 1 dollar per hour, while Large cars charge 3 dollar per hour.

- Customers can pay for the parking based on car type and parking time.

Please implement three main use cases:
1. Parking car
2. Charge fee
3. Unpark car
