- **2pc** 2 phrase commit protocal  
  - prepare: coordinator send vote request to all the participants and every participant responses coordinator with 'Yes' or 'No'
  - commit: coordinator send commit/abort to all participants according to the prepare phrase. 
  - problem  
    - no timeout check
    - data is not consistent when coordinator and participant failed together and no other participants receive commit/abort request.
- **3pc** 3 phrase commit protocal
  - cancommit: vote
  - precommit: prepare to commit with timeout check
  - docommit: do commit or abort according to precommit phrase.
  - advantage: 
    - introduce timeout mechanism in precommit and commit phrase so that participants will not hold resource forever.
    - in precommit when coordinator and participant failed together , other participant will abort due to timeout of waiting coordinator, so that it can resolve the problem of 2pc 
  - disadvantage: in do commit phrase, when coordinator is down or network between coordinator and pariticipant is not connected then pariticipants will do commit even if it should do abort.
